Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is widely used today as it is a much stronger than DES and triple DES despite being harder to implement.
The used secret key size is 128 bits (16 bytes) which means it takes 10 rounds to encrypt/decrypt the plain text.
